	                        <br><br>Mr. Fish was an expert at catching fish. This day, he decided to catch fish from the sea. He went to a nearby beach. Then, he took his fish rod and bait and steered a rented fishing boat out to sea. 
	                        <br><br>Mr. Fish has heard of the sea serpent, which was later said to be an oarfish. He wanted to catch the extremally rare oarfish before anyone else. He wanted to be famous for catching the oarfish. He saw a stream of bubble and strong ripples in the water nearby. 
	                        <br><br>Mr. Fish carefully dropped the fishing reel with the bait there and waited. He suddenly saw the ball on the fish reel go down. He immediately pulled the rod frantically to reel the fish in. He saw that the fish was huge, heavy, and silvery! He heaped the oarfish on board and kept it in a fish tank.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish was so excited that he jumped up and down.  Then he rode back to show everybody his amazing “feat”. He donated the large fish to a museum near his house. He decided to catch more fish after he caught the oarfish. He has accomplished many fishing feats and what fishy excitement will happen in the next episode: A Living Fossil? Read on to find out.

	                        <br><br>Mr. Fish had accomplished many fishing feats, including catching the Oarfish. This time, he went for a walk to the pier to fish. He hoped to have a big discovery or catch. He prepared the rod and cast the line extremely far and let the bait sink.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish wanted to catch some deep-sea fish because undiscovered fish were mostly found there. Suddenly, the line was tugged by a fish. He tried to reel the fish in, but it was too strong. He pulled and pulled. Finally, he caught this blue grey fish, after about 20 minutes of pulling.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish brought the fish, which was in a big tank now, to his friend, who knew a lot about fish. He said that it was a Coelacanth(see-luh-can-th), a fish believed to be extinct 80 million years ago! Mr. Fish was so surprized that he almost dropped the Coelacanth.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish donated the Coelacanth to the same museum that he donated the Oarfish. Then, he held a Coelacanth themed party at home. That day, Mr. Fish accomplished a fossil feat. What fate will accompany him in the next episode: The Great White Shark? Read on to find out.

	                        <br><br>Mr. Fish was good at fishing and was known for various fishing feats. Although he had caught rare and cool fish, he had never caught a shark. One day, he decided to catch one. He took a boat out to the sea to fish for sharks.
                            <br><br>After casting and waiting, Mr. Fish could only catch some bass and snapper. He decided to use larger bait. He attached a sea bass to the hook and dropped it into the water. He saw a shadow near. Suddenly, a shark emerged and ate the bass.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish pulled and pulled. Finally, the shark seemed to give up swimming away. He threw a net that happened to be on the boat to catch the shark. When he pulled it up, he was shocked to see that the shark was a great white shark. 
                            <br><br>After Mr. Fish took some photos, he released the shark to the sea to protect the marine environment. That was because great white sharks could not be kept in the museums. He was so excited. He exclaimed in excitement, “I will catch a sawfish next week!” He was right. What excitement will emerge in the next episode: The Sawed Fish (The Sawfish)? Read on to find out.

	                        <br><br>After catching the great white shark, Mr. Fish predicted that he would catch a sawfish. He got extremely excited. He said to his boat, “We will catch a sawfish!”
                            <br><br>Steering the boat out to the big blue sea, Mr. Fish looked for a spot where he might find sawfish. Then, he saw a perfect spot. He stopped the boat and threw the bait there. He felt something touching it. Then, he was shocked to see a sawfish bite on the bait. 
                            <br><br>After pulling the rod for quite a while, Mr. Fish felt the sawfish trying to cut the rope. He was worried that the sawfish would escape. Then, the sawfish stopped swimming. He immediately took the chance and reeled the fish in. 
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish was overwhelmed with joy when he found that he did catch a sawfish. He donated the fish to the museum that he donated the coelacanth and oarfish.

	                        <br><br>Fish are animals, like us, so they need to eat. Various fish eat a variety of food, including plankton, tiny fish, crustaceans, parasites, insects, medium sized fish, and many more.
                            <br><br>To digest food, fish also have a digestive system. They have about the same system as people. Because fish constantly need oxygen too, they developed lungs and gills. Fish keep their mouths open to allow water to pass though their mouths.
                            <br><br>The gills do not need to move. The water just goes though the mouth and the water is either filtered by the gills for oxygen and released or filtered by gills and absorbed by the fish.
                            <br><br>Fish also need to excrete the waste piled up in the digestive tracts. They eject though the anus (located near the stomach). Fish, like us, also have a urinary bladder. It works similarly to the anus.
                            <br><br>To swim around, fish also have a set of fins. Those fins only help the fish speed up a bit and control direction. It is the tail that helps fish swim. It is like a muscle that pushes the fish forward. Our legs are not evolved from a tail, though.
                            <br><br>To have offsprings, fish need a reproductive system. The male have sperms while the female get eggs. Some fish bear the babies like the humans, which means having a baby growing in the mother fish and getting “born”. Most fish have eggs instead.
                            <br><br>Some fish change gender after they grow to a certain size or age. These fish go through the change naturally, not by DNA. One example is a species called Wrasse.
                            <br><br>After learning a lot about the fish, please rate this add-on learning-episode. If you like this, do not hesitate to read the next part: The Science of Fish (Part 2)!

	                        <br><br>Fish possess different organs to detect predators and prey. Eyes are the most known, although some fish still do not have eyes. The eyes work similarly to terrestrial vertebrates but are rounder in shape. Some fish can even detect polarized or UV light.
                            <br><br>Although it may not seem like it, most fish have nostrils like humans. The nostrils work by detecting chemicals in the water, which is like human’s nose, which detects chemical in the air.
                            <br><br>Some fish have a special organ – the electric organ. This organ is a biochemical “battery”. It can be used for a variety of ways. With weak voltage, it can detect prey and predators, whereas with strong voltages, it can stun or kill prey and scare predators.
                            <br><br>Those fish which are hunted by the fish with electrical organs need to know when such a predator is nearby, so that they can evolve organs to detect those electrical pulses.
                            <br><br>To detect food and predators effectively, fish have evolved a lateral line, which is a line with sense organs and cells located on it. It is usually recognizable from a break in colour.
                            <br><br>A fish needs to control these organs. To do that, it requires a brain. The brain of fish is small in ratio compared to other similarly sized birds or mammals, but it makes sense because they are less evolved in comparison.
                            <br><br>Evolution has allowed some fish to evolve with a larger brain and even to human size. The Coelacanth or other lobe finned fish probably evolved to land animals.
                            <br><br>If this episode is interesting, never forget to read the next Mr. Fish story “The Giant Catch”.

	                        <br><br>After catching the saw fish, Mr. Fish decided to retire from adventurous fishing, but continued normal fishing. Today was a lucky day of fishing.
                            <br><br>Steering his boat to the big blue sea, Mr. Fish felt a cool breeze blowing. “A nice day for fishing,” he muttered to himself. He dropped the hook with the bait attached into the water. He saw a giant shadow moving slowly and silently in the water towards the bait.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish knew this fish was slow-to-bite. He waited as patient as a shark, ready to grab its prey. He discovered a triangular fin moving by, signalling a shark. Suddenly, a wave that shook the boat violently came – it was a big bite.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish immediately reeled the fish in. It was too strong. Snap! The was broken. Red with anger, he tried again with his best rod: Strong Liner 5000. Using the same bait, he quickly got the bite again. The fishing rod, being the best automatic model, pulled the line automatically.
                            <br><br>Even with an advanced fishing rod, Mr. Fish still could not reel the fish in easily. Two hours had passed, but neither side has won. Then, the fish gave a wrong turn. Mr. Fish now had the best position. With a lot of effort, he reeled the fish in. 
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish used a fishing robot to pull the fish out of the water. “No, it couldn’t be. It is a fishing legend!” he exclaimed, for now he caught a whale shark, which was the largest fish species in the world. Mr. Fish almost fainted.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish bought the gigantic fish to his friend working at the museum. He further proved that it was indeed a whale shark. Mr. Fish donated the fish to the museum, as usual. All museum staff were excited.

	                        <br><br>Mr. Fish had lot of fishing experiences, but he had retired into adventurous fishing only. Today he got a heavy fishing rod hook and prepared for a great fishing trip.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish drove his old companion, his boat, to the sea. After lunch, he seemed to have found a good spot. He dropped the hook and bait into the water, and watched it sink. He held the rod patiently and tightly.
                            <br><br>A movement was felt by Mr. Fish. He thought the fish was just checking. He reeled the line slowly in. He stopped after a few turns. A few waves splashed the side of the boat. Then the string was pulled.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish reeled it in, making him tired. He could see the fish. Mr. Fish was scared to death by the mere look of it. Giant teeth with a long and slender body, it was the Viperfish. He caught it and took it to the boat. 
                            <br><br>The fish suddenly bit the string. Mr. Fish got a net immediately. After attempting to pin the fish to the ground, he got a deep gash on the arm. Then, the fish bounced itself upward and jumped back to the ocean.
                            <br><br>It was a big loss! This loss to Mr. Fish only made him more determined to catch fish. Read the next episode “The Colourful Catch” to find out more.

                            <br><br>After catching the Viperfish which escaped, Mr Fish was angry. He wanted to catch a fish to take revenge on the escaped Viperfish. He decided to take action in the deep sea.
                            <br><br>In his new adventure, Mr. Fish added a 60kg weight to the bait. It was so heavy so it was impossible for Mr Fish to throw the bait. He drove his boat out to the sea once again and dropped the bait where he knew it would reach the midnight zone.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish felt a slight tug but did not pull the bait back yet. The tug then became a pull. Mr. Fish knew it was time to reel it in. He felt that this fish must be light, as the bait was going up as if the fish was not there!
                            <br><br>After Mr. Fish reeled in the fish, he was shocked. He had never missed a fish before. The line was dangling there in the air. There was a Viperfish fang sticking out of the weight. Mr. Fish went as angry as a charging bull. He punched the boat only to get hurt.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish angrily steered the boat back to land, as he forgot to bring extra hooks. He decided he would stop fishing in the sea for some time. Instead, he would fish in freshwater. He knew freshwater fish will not be too big, so he prepared only small hooks this time.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish went to a nearby river and threw the bait. He felt a slight tug, which alerted him that a fish was nearby. He felt a stronger tug, only to see nothing apart from the hook when he reeled in the hook. Therefore, he was furious. He jabbed a bait that he knew must attract fish on the hook.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish felt a fish bite and reeled the hook back in. He saw a common bluegill. He knew that sometimes the good would come after the bad so he persevered. This time, he got something rare – a two headed mutant Neon Tetra. 
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish mailed the specimen to the museum that he donated his other fish. He was so proud of being able to contribute to the collection at the museum. He continued fishing again. After throwing the bait, a fish already bit the hook. He reeled the fish in and saw that it was a Betta.
                            <br><br>Mr. Fish decided it would be a perfect pet as the Betta was colourful and small. He liked it a lot. He brought a fish tank for it and fed it with some fish food. Now Mr. Fish finally had a pet. He could hardly stop wondering what would happen next. Read “The Shocking Catch” to find out.
